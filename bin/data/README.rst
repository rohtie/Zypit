Create a directory named ``project`` inside this directory.
Zypit will use the ``project`` directory for your shaders, textures and the project file.

It is recommended to track your ``project`` folder using git.
For an example project, clone `Zypit Tech Demo <https://github.com/rohtie/Zypit-tech-demo>`_ to `project` directory like this: ``git clone git@github.com:rohtie/Zypit-tech-demo.git project``
